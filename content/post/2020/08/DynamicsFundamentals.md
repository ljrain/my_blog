My last Microsoft exam was when I obtained my MCSE + Internet; this was over 20 years ago. So, things have changed a lot!

I have been working with Dynamics 365 for about 8 years now, started with Power Platform during it's release. During my preparations for my MCSE, I read a lot of hard copy books.

## Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 Fundamentals

The first exam that I pursued was [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/d365-fundamentals](**Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 Fundamentals**). I have b een working with the platform for many years now, so I am very comfortable working through issues that are common as well as quickly building solutions.
