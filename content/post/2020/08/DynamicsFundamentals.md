My last Microsoft exam was when I obtained my MCSE + Internet; this was over 20 years ago. So, things have changed a lot! 

## Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 Fundamentals

The first exam that I decided to pursue was [Microsoft Certified: Dynamics 365 Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/d365-fundamentals).

The Learning Path that is provided in the link above is a great way to prepare for the exam. Microsoft has been building out the Microsoft Learn system, this should be the primary source of content as this is directly from Microsoft. The Learning Paths will also refer you to more detailed technical documentation available from Microsoft. 

Many of the Learning Paths also have labs avialable, the labs are in place to help reinforce the topics covered as well as give you some hands on experience with the topic.
