Having been in the computer industry professionally for over 20 years now, I have been involved in projects covering various aspects of technology as well as several types of industries. Throughout my career I have adapted and enthusatically learned new technologies. 

![:left](/images/lou/lou_emoj_200x200.jfif)Early in my career I worked with a large retail company and helped them establish a Wildcat! BBS system that provided users with access to UseNet Groups and support for their computer purchases. Based on the value from this BBS we expanded to a second location with a nightly sync between the two as well as UseNet groups! **This was really cool at the time!** 

From there, I moved on to a support role in Atlanta, GA for an international company. Where I was SME (Subject Matter Expect) on the Windows network as well as the AS/400. I learned a lot while in a support role, like troubleshooting and resolving issues on a phone with international users. During this time I was pursuing my MCSE + Internet. 

As we approached Y2K, I was transitioning into a software developement role. Managing a network and adding a T1 circuit was part of this transition. During this time, the **"dotCom boom"**, we worked with clients as we built out web applications.
