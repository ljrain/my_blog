Having been in the computer industry professionally for over 20 years now, I have been involved in projects covering various aspects of technology covering several types of industries. This depth has benefited me with learning from some of the best people in the industry and expanding my knowledge set to handling many different situations.

![:left](/images/lou/lou_emoj_200x200.jfif)Starting early on I worked with a large retail company and established a Wildcat! BBS system that provided users with access to UseNet Groups and support for their computer purchases. Based on the value from this BBS we expanded to a second location with a nightly sync between the two as well as UseNet groups! **This was really cool at the time!**

I have maintained a site for nearly 10 years in one form or another. With my focus now on the Microosft Power Platform I wanted to re-launch this site!

I will be posting things I learn, issues I run into and my thoughts on all things Power Platform.
